<UnstableConstraintWarning />

Takes prioritizations of employees into account during scheduling.
The constraint can be used in one of two ways: the prioritization of employees can be configured for the **demands** or for the **shifts**.

- Demands:
  For every demand, it is possible to provide a prioritization of employees. This will have the effect that, given a demand, an employee with a higher priority will be more likely to cover that demand than an employee with a lower priority.

- Shifts:
  For every shift, it is possible to provide a prioritization of employees. This will have the effect that, given a shift, an employee with a higher priority will be more likely to be scheduled for that shift than an employee with a lower priority.

<Warning>
  It is recommended only to use Prioritization for shifts when working with
  [ShiftDemands](/concepts/demands#shiftdemand). When used with
  [TimeDemand](/concepts/demands#timedemand), it can happen that shifts are
  planned that do not cover demands fully.
</Warning>

## Priority scores

A prioritization of employees for a demand/shift is defined using priority scores. The priority scores can be numbers between 0 and 100, where 100 is the highest priority.
Priority scores should be assigned to employees, such that more preferred employees are given higher scores than less preferred employees.
In addition, a priority score of -1 can be used to denote that an employee can never be scheduled for a demand/shift. Priority scores of -1 are therefore **hard constraints** (similar to [`STRICT` importance](/constraints/index#constraint-importance)).

## Priority score matrix

In the payload, these employee prioritizations for demands/shifts have to be provided in a matrix. This matrix has employees in its rows and demands/shifts in its columns. Priority scores are the elements of the matrix.

In order to allow for more compact matrices, a group of demands/shifts which have the same prioritization of employees can be sent in as one column of the matrix. The columns of the matrix therefore defined as groups of demands/shifts.
If there are demands/shifts that cannot be grouped, they have to be sent in as a group of one.
The same goes for employees; employees that are prioritized in the exact same way for all shifts/demands can be sent in as one group in one row of the matrix.

## Payload

See the payload example below to get started and check out the API reference for full configurability of the constraint.

<Tip>
  The following defines a prioritization based on whether employees have a driver's licence or not.
  Employees with a driver's licence are prioritized for delivery demands, and employees without a driver's licence are prioritized for sorting demands.
  The employees without a driver's licence cannot be scheduled for delivery demands.

```json
