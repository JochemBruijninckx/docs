title: Period Distribution
description: Set rules for how many periods (marked by labels) an employee can work.
---

Define rules to improve the distribution of inconvenient periods among employees.

## Explanation

Within the context of this constraint, a period is considered 'worked' for an employee if they work any shift during that period, and
'free' if they do not. The constraint allows you to set rules for how many periods an employee can work, how many they can work in succession,
and how many free periods they must have surrounding a working period.

Often seen use cases are the distribution of weekends, holidays, or other inconvenient periods among employees.

## Maximum worked periods

An easy use case is to limit how many worked periods an employee can have.

<Tip>
  The constraint specified below makes it undesirable for employees to work more than 2 weekends. Notice that working a shift is only considered
  as working a period if it overlaps for at least 6 hours with the period, as configured in the `overlapRules`.

To work with `labels` on periods, make sure you have set a definition for the period label in the `configuration` part of the payload.

```json
{
  "id": "pd-max-weekends",
  "importance": "MEDIUM",
  "maxWorkedPeriods": 2,
  "overlapRules": {
    "minOverlapHours": 6
  },
  "periods": {
    "labels": ["WEEKENDS"]
  }
}
```

</Tip>

## Minimum worked periods

Alternatively, the constraint can be used to encourage a minimum amount of worked periods for an employee.

<Tip>
  The constraint specified below sets a target for the minimum number of weekends during which the employee works any shift.
  `minWorkedPeriods` is never treated as a strict lower bound, but rather as a target that the solver will try to reach.

```json
{
  "id": "pd-min-weekends",
  "minWorkedPeriods": 3,
  "periods": {
    "labels": ["WEEKENDS"]
  }
}
```

</Tip>

## Maximum consecutive worked periods

Alternatively, the constraint can be used to limit how many undesirable periods an employee can work in succession.

<Tip>
  The constraint specified below makes it strictly forbidden for an employee to work 3 holidays in a row. Notice that with the way periods are defined,
  working both days of Christmas still only counts as working **one** period. If the days of Christmas should count as working separate holidays,
  you would need to define them as separate periods.

```json
{
  "id": "pd-max-consecutive-holidays",
  "isStrict": true,
  "maxConsecutiveWorkedPeriods": 2,
  "periods": {
    "customDefinitions": [
      {
        "startDay": {
          "date": "2024-12-25"
        },
        "endDay": {
          "date": "2024-12-26"
        }
      },
      {
        "startDay": {
          "date": "2024-12-31"
        },
        "endDay": {
          "date": "2024-12-31"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

</Tip>

## Minimum surrounding free periods

The constraint can also be used to enforce a minimum number of free periods surrounding a worked period.

Note that it is currently not supported to use the `minSurroundingFreePeriods` property in combination with the `maxConsecutiveWorkedPeriods` property.

<Tip>
  The constraint specified below makes it strictly required for an employee to have at least 1 free weekend surrounding each worked weekend.

```json
{
  "id": "pd-min-surrounding-free-weekends",
  "isStrict": true,
  "minSurroundingFreePeriods": 1,
  "periods": {
    "labels": ["WEEKENDS"]
  }
}
```
