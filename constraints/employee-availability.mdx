description: Block employees from working on specific days or shifts, or make it desired/undesired for them to work on specific days or shifts.

import SchemaSnippet from "/snippets/api/employeeAvailabilityConstraint.mdx";

This constraint can be used for three purposes, all related to which periods or shifts an employee should be considered available for:

1. Mark an employee as **strictly unavailable** for specific periods or shifts.
2. Mark an employee as **available but undesirable** for specific periods or shifts.
3. Mark an employee as **available and desirable** for specific periods or shifts.

## Strict unavailability

To define certain periods as strictly unavailable for an employee, simply specify the periods in the constraint. The solver will then never assign shifts to the employee during these periods.

<Tip>
  The below constraint makes it strictly impossible for employee with id 'employee-1' to work on weekends.

```json
{
  "id": "eac-weekends",
  "importance": "STRICT",
  "isDesired": false,
  "filters": {
    "employees": {
      "ids": ["employee-1"]
    }
  },
  "periods": {
    "labels": ["WEEKENDS"]
  }
}
```

</Tip>

## Undesired availability

To mark that an employee would rather not work during certain periods, set the `isDesired` field to `false` and choose an [importance level](/constraints/index#constraint-importance) different than `STRICT`. The solver will try to avoid assigning shifts to the employee during these periods, but it is not strictly forbidden.

<Tip>
  The below constraint makes it undesirable for employee with id 'employee-1' to work on Mondays or Thursdays.

```json
{
  "id": "eac-undesired-mondays-thursdays",
  "importance": "HIGH",
  "isDesired": false,
  "filters": {
    "employees": {
      "ids": ["employee-1"]
    }
  },
  "periods": {
    "days": {
      "daysOfWeek": ["MON", "THU"]
    }
  }
}
```

</Tip>

## Desired availability

To mark that an employee prefers working on certain periods or shifts, set the `isDesired` field to `true` and choose an [importance level](/constraints/index#constraint-importance) different than `STRICT` (`STRICT` is currently not supported on desired constraints).

<Tip>
  The below constraint makes it preferred to assign shifts with shift label `night` to employee with id 'employee-1' on Mondays, Tuesdays or Wednesdays.

```json
{
  "id": "eac-desired-night-shifts",
  "importance": "MEDIUM",
  "isDesired": true,
  "filters": {
    "employees": {
      "ids": ["employee-1"]
    },
    "shifts": {
      "labels": ["night"]
    }
  },
  "periods": {
    "days": {
      "daysOfWeek": ["MON", "TUE", "WED"]
    }
  }
}
```
