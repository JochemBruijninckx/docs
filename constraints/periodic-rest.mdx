import SchemaSnippet from "/snippets/api/periodicRestConstraint.mdx";

The Periodic Rest Constraint can be used to set a minimum duration of continuous rest that an employee gets in a period. Of all the periods of rest the employee gets, the constraint ensures that at least one of them is of the specified minimum duration per period.
A good example of this constraint is to ensure that employees get at least 48 hours of continuous rest in each week, so that they will always have at least 2 consecutive days off (regardless of which days it is planned on).

<Tip>
  The following example defines a periodic rest constraint that ensures that all employees get at least one 48-hour long continuous rest in each week.

```json
{
  "periodicRestConstraints": [
    {
      "id": "48-hours-per-week",
      "minimumContinuousRestDuration": {
        "hours": 48
      },
      "periods": {
        "recurrentDefinition": {
          "daysPerPeriod": 7
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

  The following example defines a periodic rest constraint that ensures that all employees get at least one 72-hour long continuous rest in each month.

```json
{
  "periodicRestConstraints": [
    {
      "id": "72-hours-per-month",
      "minimumContinuousRestDuration": {
        "hours": 72
      },
      "periods": {
        "customDefinitions": [
          {
            "startDate": "2022-01-01",
            "endDate": "2022-01-31"
          },
          {
            "startDate": "2022-02-01",
            "endDate": "2022-02-28"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
