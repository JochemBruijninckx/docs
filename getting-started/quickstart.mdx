## Run your first job

<Steps>
  <Step title="Authenticate">
    Create a POST request to the Visma Connect API to authenticate. See the API Reference for detailed instructions.
  </Step>

<Step title="Specify the problem">
  Before running your first job, you need to specify the problem to be solved.
  Feel free to use the example payload as a starting point and check out the API
  reference for configurations. Use the `/feasibility` endpoint to evaluate the
  configuration.
</Step>

<Step title="Generate your first roster">
  Use the `/jobs` endpoint to start a job. The response will contain a
  `statusCode` and a `jobId` for your job.
</Step>

<Step title="Check job status">
  Use the `/jobs/{jobId}` endpoint to get the status of the job.
</Step>

  <Step title="Retrieve results">
    Use the `/jobs/{jobId}/result` endpoint to get the current best result of the job. This will always be updated with the best result as long as the job is running.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Generate code from OpenAPI Specification

The Automatic Rostering API is built on the OpenAPI Specification. You can generate code for your preferred programming language using the OpenAPI Specification.

<Tip>
  The easiest way to get some hands-on experience with running the API is to
  follow our [getting-started
  guides](/automatic-rostering/quickstart/tutorial_1), so if you haven't checked
  those out yet, we highly recommend starting there.
</Tip>

Once you have some experience with designing the payloads, we highly recommend using code-generation tools to help you get started with the API through the OpenAPI specification.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get the OpenAPI specification">
    The OpenAPI specification for the Automatic Rostering service can be found [here](https://docs.optimization-rostering.prod.visma.net/openapi.yml).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate code">
    Use the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/) or [Swagger Codegen](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/) to generate code for your preferred programming language.
    
    For example, to generate a C# client with the OpenAPI Generator, you can use the following command:
    
    ```bash
    npx @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli generate -i ./openapi.yml -g csharp
    ```
    
    <Warning>
      There seems to be some conflicts if attempting to use the hosted resource directly (i.e., calling with the input: `-i https://docs.optimization-rostering.prod.visma.net/openapi.yml`), so it is recommended to download the file and use it locally.
    </Warning>
