    # Visma Connect Token Retrieval

    1. Create a POST request to the Visma Connect API:
       - For the stage environment, use: [https://connect.identity.stagaws.visma.com/connect/token](https://connect.identity.stagaws.visma.com/connect/token)
       - For the production environment, use: [https://connect.visma.com/connect/token](https://connect.visma.com/connect/token)

    2. In the header of your request, specify `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

    3. In the request body, specify the following parameters:
       - `grant_type: client_credentials`
       - `client_id: YOUR_ID_FROM_STEP_1.3`
       - `client_secret: YOUR_SECRET_FROM_STEP_1.9`
       - `scope: SCOPE_FROM_STEP_1.7`

    4. Send the request and retrieve the `access_token` from the response.

    5. Include the `Authorization` header with the `Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN` for all your requests to the Automatic Rostering API.

    6. You are now ready to make requests to the Automatic Rostering API.

    prioritizationConstraint:
      type: object
      description: |-
        A soft constraint. This constraint will take priorities into account when deciding which employees to schedule.
        These priorities can be defined for either employees and timeSlots, or employees and shifts. So, given a timeSlot or 
        a shift, an employee with a higher priority score for this timeSlot/shift will be more likely to be scheduled than 
        an employee with a lower priority score for this timeSlot/shift. A priority score of -1 can be used to indicate
        that an employee must not be scheduled for a timeSlot/shift under any circumstances, making it a hard constraint.

        Just like other constraints, the weight of this constraint denotes how important the constraint is compared to other constraints.
        However, when multiple prioritizationConstraints are sent in, their weights have a slightly different effect:

        * When multiple prioritizationConstraints are sent in, the priority scores in the matrices are combined 
        using their weight to determine the "overall priorities": how prioritized employees are overall to be scheduled
        for a timeSlot/shift.

        * These "overall priorities" have reached their maximum relative importance compared to the other constraints, 
        when the weights of all prioritizationConstraints sum to 100 or more. I.e. increasing the weights more will not make the 
        prioritizations more important compared to other constraints.

        NOTE: Either timeSlotGroups (for Employee-TimeSlot Prioritization) or shiftGroups (for Employee-Shift Prioritization)
        must be specified. 

        EXAMPLE
          employeeGroups: [[employee1], [employee2]]
          demandGroups: [[MON, WED], [FRI]]

          Prioritization:
          demands      |[MON,WED]|[FRI]|
          [employee1]  |   50    | 90  |
          [employee2]  |   50    | 30  |

          PENALIZED
          week               |MON|TUE|WED|THU|FRI|SAT|SUN|
          employee1 working  | X |   | X |   |   |   |   |
          employee2 working  |   |   |   |   | X |   |   |
          explanation -> employee2 covers the demand on Friday even though employee1 has a higher priority.
                         This results in this solution getting a penalty.

          NOT PENALIZED
          week               |MON|TUE|WED|THU|FRI|SAT|SUN|
          employee1 working  | X |   |   |   | X |   |   |
          employee2 working  |   |   | X |   |   |   |   |
          explanation -> employee1 is scheduled on Friday instead of employee2, because employee1 has a higher priority.
                         There is no penalty for this solution.

    restBetweenShiftsConstraint:
      type: object
      description: |-
        Soft constraint when the weight is below 100, hard constraint when the weight is set to 100.
        This constraint allows you to set the minimum rest length between shifts.
        For example, if you set the minimum rest between shifts to 3 hours, the employee must have at least 3 hours
        of rest between shifts. If the employee has a shift from 8:00 to 12:00, the next shift can start at 15:00 at the
        earliest.

          minRestDuration = 2 hours for employee1

        considered desirable. If startWeekday is undefined, the pattern will loop.

        If multiple patterns are defined as desirable, the solver will try to find a solution for ONE AND ONLY ONE of them 
        that has highest weight. At the moment combination of multiple desirable patterns is not supported.

        If multiple patterns are defined as undesirable, the solver will try to find a
        solution that does not violate any of them.

        Only one of periods and startWeekday can be defined. If both are defined, periods will be ignored.

                          both employee1 and employee2 follows the undesired pattern. employee1 follows the pattern by 
                          working the desired shifts on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, and employee2 follows the pattern 
                          by working the desired shifts on Monday, Thursday and Sunday with allowed days off in-between. 
                          The starting shift is not important when looping (startWeekday is not defined) as long as the

        Shifts can be specified by shift id, shift types or work types and when at least two of these are specified, shifts that match all of the

The first interval is from Monday to Friday between 08:00 and 16:00, and the second interval is from Saturday to Sunday between 08:00 and 16:00. The first interval is weighted as 100 while the second interval is weighted as 50, which means that the preferences are considered less important during the weekend.

        prioritizationConstraint:
          type: object
          description: |-
            A soft constraint. This constraint will take priorities into account when deciding which employees to schedule.
            These priorities can be defined for either employees and timeSlots, or employees and shifts. So, given a timeSlot or 
            a shift, an employee with a higher priority score for this timeSlot/shift will be more likely to be scheduled than 
            an employee with a lower priority score for this timeSlot/shift. A priority score of -1 can be used to indicate
            that an employee must not be scheduled for a timeSlot/shift under any circumstances, making it a hard constraint.

            Just like other constraints, the weight of this constraint denotes how important the constraint is compared to other constraints.
            However, when multiple prioritizationConstraints are sent in, their weights have a slightly different effect:

            * When multiple prioritizationConstraints are sent in, the priority scores in the matrices are combined 
            using their weight to determine the "overall priorities": how prioritized employees are overall to be scheduled
            for a timeSlot/shift.

            * These "overall priorities" have reached their maximum relative importance compared to the other constraints, 
            when the weights of all prioritizationConstraints sum to 100 or more. I.e. increasing the weights more will not make the 
            prioritizations more important compared to other constraints.

            NOTE: Either timeSlotGroups (for Employee-TimeSlot Prioritization) or shiftGroups (for Employee-Shift Prioritization)
            must be specified. 

            EXAMPLE
              employeeGroups: [[employee1], [employee2]]
              demandGroups: [[MON, WED], [FRI]]

              Prioritization:
              demands      |[MON,WED]|[FRI]|
              [employee1]  |   50    | 90  |
              [employee2]  |   50    | 30  |

              PENALIZED
              week               |MON|TUE|WED|THU|FRI|SAT|SUN|
              employee1 working  | X |   | X |   |   |   |   |
              employee2 working  |   |   |   |   | X |   |   |
              explanation -> employee2 covers the demand on Friday even though employee1 has a higher priority.
                             This results in this solution getting a penalty.

              NOT PENALIZED
              week               |MON|TUE|WED|THU|FRI|SAT|SUN|
              employee1 working  | X |   |   |   | X |   |   |
              employee2 working  |   |   | X |   |   |   |   |
              explanation -> employee1 is scheduled on Friday instead of employee2, because employee1 has a higher priority.
                             There is no penalty for this solution.

              summary: This example defines a working time preference constraint which is applied to employees with ids 1, 2 and 3, and defines two intervals. Both intervals have work type id 0. The first interval is from Monday to Friday between 08:00 and 16:00, and the second interval is from Saturday to Sunday between 08:00 and 16:00. The first interval is weighted as 100 while the second interval is weighted as 50, which means that the preferences are considered less important during the weekend.

            This constraint defines patterns that are either desirable or undesirable. If the weight is negative, 
            the defined patterns are considered undesirable, and if the weight is positive, the defined patterns are 
            considered desirable. If startWeekday is undefined, the pattern will loop.

            If multiple patterns are defined as desirable, the solver will try to find a solution for ONE AND ONLY ONE of them 
            that has highest weight. At the moment combination of multiple desirable patterns is not supported.

            If multiple patterns are defined as undesirable, the solver will try to find a
            solution that does not violate any of them.

            Only one of periods and startWeekday can be defined. If both are defined, periods will be ignored.

                              by working the desired shifts on Monday, Thursday and Sunday with allowed days off in-between. 
                              The starting shift is not important when looping (startWeekday is not defined) as long as the

            This is employee level constraint that is applied to each employee separately.
            This constraint defines how many days there should be between a given shift if shift is assigned to same employee.
            If the number of days is equal to or more than the number of days in the roster, it is advised to use the ShiftUtilizationConstraint with a maxOccurrence of 1 instead.
            Shifts can be specified by shift id, shift types or work types and when at least two of these are specified, shifts that match all of the
            specified criteria are constrained. Constraint also allows to specify employee ids to which constraint is applied.

            Days between shifts is counted as difference between days on which shifts are assigned.
            If shift is assigned to employee on Monday and Thursday, there are 2 days between shifts - Tuesday and Wednesday.

                Summing all of the buckets will equal the total hours in the planning period with a demand. 
                It is not possible to have more than maximum demand as max is a hard constraint.

                EXAMPLE
                Demand levels: | min | ideal | max |
                               |  3  |   6   |  8  |
                Explanation --> min, ideal and max demands for all below hours. It is hence never possible to have more than 
                  8 employees in any hour.

                  the case anywhere else, so the outcome is 1 wall hour in the lessThanMin range. In the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th

                Sums the threshold hours for each demand level (the target), and the planned hours up to that demand level. 

                EXAMPLE
                Demand levels: | min | ideal | max |
                               |  3  |   6   |  8  |

                Fulfilment: | 2 | 6 | 6 | 7 | 6 | 4 | 3 | 5 |
                Explanation --> The first row represents eight consecutive hours, and the second row shows the number of 
                  employees assigned shifts in those hours.

                Demand fte hours: |   min   |   ideal   |   max   |

                Explanation --> where t is target hours and p is planned hours. 
                  The target hours are calculated by multiplying the demand levels with the number of hours in the period. 
                  Hence, the target hours for min, ideal and max are 3*8=24, 6*8=48 and 8*8=64 respectively, since all hours 
                  have the same demand levels.
                  The planned hours are calculated by multiplying the demand levels with the hourly fulfilment up to the 
                  demand level. i.e. demand level * min(demand level, hourly fulfilment). For example for the minimum demand, 
                  this is 3*7=21 for hours 2-8, plus 2 for hour 1 => 23 planned minimum fte hours. This means that there was 
                  only one missing hour to have the minimum demand fulfilled for every hour.
