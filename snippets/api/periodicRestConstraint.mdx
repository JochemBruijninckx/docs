<ResponseField name="periodicRestConstraint" type="periodicRestConstraint Object">
  This constraint defines the minimum duration of continuous rest that an employee should have within a given period. One periodic rest constraint can be applied to multiple periods. For example, the constraint can be used to require that each employee receives at least 48 hours of rest within each 7-day period. The constraint can be applied to specific employees, and can be configured to only include specific shifts or work types when calculating the realized rest duration.
