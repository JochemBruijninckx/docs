<ResponseField name="employeeUtilizationConstraint" type="employeeUtilizationConstraint Object">
  This constraint can be used to set targets for the number of hours worked by employees. The minimum number of hours is treated as a target, while the maximum number of hours acts as a hard limit and will never be exceeded. The constraint can be applied to specific employees, work types, or shifts. The constraint can also be applied to a specific time period, in which case it will act as a target for the number of hours worked in that period.
