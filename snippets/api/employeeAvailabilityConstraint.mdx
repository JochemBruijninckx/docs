    <ResponseField name="importance" type="string (enum: NONE | VERY_LOW | LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH | ...)" required>
      The importance of the constraint. The higher the importance, the more the solver will take the constraint into account. Under strict importance, the constraint may never be violated.
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="isDesired" type="boolean" required>
      If set to true, it will be considered preferable for employees to work the shifts that this constraint applies to during the specified periods. If set to false, the solver will try to avoid assigning applicable shifts to employees during the specified periods. If importance is set to strict, this must be false.
