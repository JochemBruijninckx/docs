## January 2026

- Added labels on shifts and employees, allowing you to easily target groups of shifts or employees in constraints. Labels on shifts serve as a replacement for shiftTypeIds.
- Made WorkTypes no longer required - not having a workType on a shift will make it default to an FTE factor of 1.
- Improved the filtering options on constraints. Advanced filters can now be applied (which allows for NOT and AND filtering).
- Renamed readOnly and locked to isReadOnly and isLocked, respectively, for consistency.
- Replaced remaning usages of the scheduleDays schema with the new days schema. This now also allows for the use of weekdays when specifying preassigned shifts or demands.

## December 2025

- Introduce roles on preassigned shifts, allowing you to predefine the role the employee will have when working the shift.

## Sep 2025

- Introduced [**ConsecutiveConstraint**](/constraints/consecutive). This can be used to set targets on the minimum and maximum number of consecutive shifts that an employee can work.

## May 2025

- Introduced [**CooldownConstraint**](/constraints/cooldown) as a replacement for RestBetweenShiftsConstraint. This new constraint can handle cooldowns between different kinds of shifts.
- Introduced labels on constraints. Currently only used for legibility of payloads.

## March 2025

- Introduced `periods` on employee attributes. This can be used to define attributes that are only valid during certain periods.
- Improved `shiftLabelRules` to allow for automatic assignment of shift labels based on the shift's properties.
- Introduced `applyWorkloadScaling` on [**FairnessConstraint**](/constraints/fairness), which allows the fairness criterion to take an employee's workload into account when comparing the (in)conveniences of the constraints.

## February 2025

- Made significant improvements to the impact of [**PatternConstraint**](/constraints/pattern) on the created rosters.

## December 2024

- Introduced [**FairnessConstraint**](/constraints/fairness) as a replacement of the old `fairness` property on constraints. This new constraint allows for the application of fairness across multiple constraints, for example to balance the amount of undesired hours that employees work.

## November 2024

- Introduced [**PatternConstraint**](/constraints/pattern) which is an improved version of the **ShiftPatternConstraint**. Switching to this new constraint should improve many previously existing challenges with configuring the **ShiftPatternConstraint**.
- Introduced `maxConsecutivePeriods` on the [**PeriodDistributionConstraint**](/constraints/period-distribution). This allows you to set a maximum number of consecutive periods that an employee can work.
- Introduced `minWorkedPeriods` on the [**PeriodDistributionConstraint**](/constraints/period-distribution). This allows you to set a target minimum number of periods that an employee must work.

## October 2024

- Added `days` on periods to allow for more flexible period definitions.
- Added `idealShifts` and `idealHours` on [**EmployeeUtilizationConstraint**](/constraints/employee-utilization) to allow for more flexible utilization targets.
- Introduced `overlapRules` on [**EmployeeUtilizationConstraint**](/constraints/employee-utilization) and [**PeriodDistributionConstraint**](/constraints/period-distribution) which allow you to configure under which conditions a shift is considered to have enough overlap for the constraint to take it into account.
- Introduced [**EmployeeAvailabilityConstraint**](/constraints/employee-availability) as a replacement for **BlockedTimeConstraint** and **WorkingTimePreferenceConstraint**.
- Grouped filter options into `filters` on all non-deprecated constraints. This has improved consistency between constraints in terms of the available configuration options, and made it easier to find which filters a constraint supports.

## September 2024

- Marked many constraints as deprecated. These constraints will be supported via new or previously existing constraints in an effort to simplify the constraint configuration. This update comes with significant improvements to our internal handling of the constraints, improving solver performance. Below shows the mapping of the deprecated constraints to their replacements:

| Deprecated Constraint                  | Replacement Constraint                                                   | Detailed Description                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **BlockedTimeConstraint**              | [**EmployeeAvailabilityConstraint**](/constraints/employee-availability) | Strict and undesired instances of the EmployeeAvailabilityConstraint will completely block an employee from working the specified times.                                                  |
| **WorkingTimePreferenceConstraint**    | [**EmployeeAvailabilityConstraint**](/constraints/employee-availability) | Non-strict instances of the EmployeeAvailabilityConstraint can prioritize or avoid (based on whether the constraint is desired) certain time periods or shifts for employees.             |
| **ShiftPatternConstraint**             | [**PatternConstraint**](/constraints/pattern)                            | The PatternConstraint is a more robust version of the ShiftPatternConstraint, with a uniform way of handling desired/undesired versions of the constraint.                                |
| **WeekendDistributionConstraint**      | [**PeriodDistributionConstraint**](/constraints/period-distribution)     | The PeriodDistributionConstraint is a more generalized version of the WeekendDistributionConstraint, allowing for more flexible period definitions.                                       |
| **WeekRestConstraint**                 | [**PeriodicRestConstraint**](/constraints/periodic-rest)                 | The PeriodicRestConstraint is a more generalized version of the WeekRestConstraint, allowing for more flexible period definitions.                                                        |
| **ShiftUtilizationConstraint**         | [**EmployeeUtilizationConstraint**](/constraints/employee-utilization)   | The EmployeeUtilizationConstraint is a more generalized version of the ShiftUtilizationConstraint, with more filter options and with the option to set targets in either shifts or hours. |
| **ShiftLayoutConstraint**              | **RestBetweenShiftsConstraint**                                          | Because they serve similar functionality, our goal is to make RestBetweenShiftsConstraint be able to handle all functionality within the same constraint.                                 |
| **ConsecutiveTimeOffConstraint**       | [**PeriodicRestConstraint**](/constraints/periodic-rest)                 | Because they serve similar functionality, our goal is to make PeriodicRestConstraint be able to handle all functionality within the same constraint.                                      |
| **NewWorkingDayConstraint**            | **TBD**                                                                  | No name has been decided yet, but our goal is to group this constraint together with ExistingWorkingDayChangeConstraint because of the high similarity between the two.                   |
| **ExistingWorkingDayChangeConstraint** | **TBD**                                                                  | No name has been decided yet, but our goal is to group this constraint together with NewWorkingDayConstraint because of the high similarity between the two.                              |

- Introduced priorities on demands, allowing you to prioritize certain demands over others.
- Introduced `periodLabels` in configuration. These allow you to easily reuse period definitions in other places in the payload. For example, it could be useful to create a generic 'weekend' periodLabel, or a 'public-holiday' label.

## August 2024

- Introduced [**PeriodDistributionConstraint**](/constraints/period-distribution), a generalized version of the **WeekendDistributionConstraint**.
- Improved the configuration options on [**EmployeeUtilizationConstraint**](/constraints/employee-utilization). It now also supports periods.

## July 2024

- Improvements to the request payload format for better readability and structure
- `id`, `organisationId` and `scheduleType` are now grouped in the new `jobInfo` object
