Many aspects that should be taken into consideration in producing a roster are only applicable during certain periods of time. For example, think of weekly limits for work, or the availability of employees during certain days of the week.
Specifying such periods of time is done using the `periods` field. This page explains how to configure this field for different use cases.

Periods can be defined in three different ways:

1. Reference to specific days in the roster.
2. Reference to custom periods defined by start and end days/times.
3. Reference to recurrent periods (like weeks, weekends, nights, etc.)

## Periods created through days

The most basic way to define periods is to refer to specific days in the roster. This is done by using the `days` field in the `periods` object.

Within this object, you can specify specific days using `dates` (in `CALENDAR` payloads) or `dayIndices` (in `RECURRING` payloads).

```json title="Referring to specific days using dates"
{
  "periods": {
    "days": {
      "dates": ["2026-01-01", "2026-01-02", "2026-01-05"]
    }
  }
}
```

Alternatively, you can specify the days of the week using `daysOfWeek`. For example, the following periods definition will refer to all Wednesdays and Fridays in the roster.

```json title="Referring to specific days using days of week"
{
  "periods": {
    "days": {
      "daysOfWeek": ["WED", "FRI"]
    }
  }
}
```

Finally, you can add a `startTime` and `endTime` to the `days` object to specify a time interval during the day. For example, the following periods definition will refer to all evenings on Wednesdays and Fridays.
This could be useful for instance to specify that an employee is not available for work during these times (though they are still available for work earlier in these days).

```json title="Referring to specific days using days of week and time interval"
{
  "periods": {
    "days": {
      "daysOfWeek": ["WED", "FRI"],
      "startTime": "18:00",
      "endTime": "23:00"
    }
  }
}
```

<Info>
  Creating periods through days will always consider each day in the roster as a
  separate period. This is relevant on some constraints where the targets of the
  constraint are applied to each period separately.

## Periods created through custom definitions

If you need to create periods consisting of multiple days, you can use the `customDefinitions` field in the `periods` object. These are defined through a start and end day (and optionally a start and end time).
For example, the following periods definition will refer to the period from January 1st to January 5th and the period from February 10th to February 14th.

```json title="Referring to a custom period using start and end days"
{
  "periods": {
    "customDefinitions": [
      {
        "startDate": "2026-01-01",
        "endDate": "2026-01-05"
      },
      {
        "startDate": "2026-02-10",
        "endDate": "2026-02-14"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Similarly to the `days` field, you can also add a `startTime` and `endTime` to the `customDefinitions` object to specify a time interval during the day.
For example, the following periods definition will refer to the period from 10:00 on January 1st to 18:00 on January 5th.

```json title="Referring to a custom period using start and end days and time interval"
{
  "periods": {
    "customDefinitions": [
      {
        "startDate": "2026-01-01",
        "endDate": "2026-01-05",
        "startTime": "10:00",
        "endTime": "18:00"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Finally, custom period definitions allow you to choose whether the start and end time should apply to each day individually.
For example, the following periods definition will refer to all periods of time between 20:00 and 06:00 on every day between January 1st and January 31st.

```json title="Referring to a custom period using start and end days and time interval and applying time to all days"
{
  "periods": {
    "customDefinitions": [
      {
        "startDate": "2026-01-01",
        "endDate": "2026-01-31",
        "startTime": "20:00",
        "endTime": "06:00",
        "applyTimeToAllDays": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

By default, `applyTimeToAllDays` is set to `false`.
