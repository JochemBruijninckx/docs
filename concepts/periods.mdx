Many aspects that should be taken into consideration in producing a roster are only applicable during certain periods of time. For example, think of weekly limits for work, or the availability of employees during certain days of the week.
Specifying such periods of time is done using the `periods` field. This page explains how to configure this field for different use cases.

Periods can be defined in three different ways:

1. Referral to specific days in the roster.
2. Referall to custom periods defined by start and end days/times.
3. Reference to recurrent periods (like weeks, weekends, nights, etc.)

## Periods defined by days

The most basic way to define periods is to refer to specific days in the roster. This is done by using the `days` field in the `periods` object.

Within this object, you can specify specific days using `dates` in `CALENDAR` payloads or `dayIndices` in `RECURRING` payloads.

```json title="Referring to specific days using dates"
{
  "periods": {
    "days": {
      "dates": ["2026-01-01", "2026-01-02", "2026-01-05"]
    }
  }
}
```

Alternatively, you can specify the days of the week using `daysOfWeek`. For example, the following periods definition will refer to all Wednesdays and Fridays in the roster.

```json title="Referring to specific days using days of week"
{
  "periods": {
    "days": {
      "daysOfWeek": ["WED", "FRI"]
    }
  }
}
```

Finally, you can add a `startTime` and `endTime` to the `days` object to specify a time interval during the day. For example, the following periods definition will refer to all evenings on Wednesdays and Fridays.
This could be useful for instance to specify that an employee is not available for work during these times (though they are still available for work earlier in these days).

```json title="Referring to specific days using days of week and time interval"
{
  "periods": {
    "days": {
      "daysOfWeek": ["WED", "FRI"],
      "startTime": "18:00",
      "endTime": "23:00"
    }
  }
}
```
